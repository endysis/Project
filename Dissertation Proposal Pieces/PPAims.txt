Intro 

If we can convice people there walking straigh when really there walking in a bend we could use a smaller space.

But could also be use for rehabilitation.















Aim & Objectives

Aims and objectives needs to be measurable





Cant evidence how VR can influence motor responses or the sensory 

Whether a users perception of our motion or movement can be deceived by virtual reality.

Perception of motions be perceived.












Aim:
To investigate the extent to which a users perception of motion can be devceived within virtual reality.


Objectives:

Understand how our perceptions can influence a humans motion.
- It is imperitve to recognise perception influnce in motion. This will be a crucial assest when constructing a system and scenario which targets the primary aim. Information will be discoverd through reasrch of academic journals and book relating to cognitive science.

Develop a scenario which forces a paricipant to rely on a sensory system to achieve a given goal.
- A scenario presents a task and promtpts the user's to achieve a goal. A given task will to be very simple, i.e. walking in a straight line towards a point. From this, simple tasks will enable a clear and consise way to gather evaluative data. The scenario will be displayed within a virtual environment, therefore technological possiblities and limitations have to be considered. 

Develop a VR system which presents the scenario.
- The system will adhere to all scenario requirements using the Unity 5 Game engine to create the virtual environment. A HTC Vive will be utilised to display the scenario and track the user within a virtual plane.

Construct one or a set of experiments which utilise the system to gather participant results.
- A given experiment will evaluate the performance of a user using the VR system.
- Evaluation of the project will heavily rely on the results the experiment produces.
- Dont really know what else to write.




























What takes over when one of our sensors is shut off?















Devleopment of the VR System




Develop a scenario to test.
Construct a set of experiments.
Build VR System.




















To discover the extent to which Virtual Reality can deceive a users perception of trajectory and motion?
To focused.

Aim: Discover the 


Investigating the use of VR for deception or infulencing sensor motor inputs.

Can you make someone walk in a circle without them realising they are walking in a circle.

Whether VR can be used to alter perceptions.

Why trajectory and motion.

Sensory motor changes and influences?











Evaluation of participant
