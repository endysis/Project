I have included more steps within my GANT chart than in my objectives, 
is this ok?



Conducting general research will be essential when 

Scenario Design
The scenario design will require steady thought, and will take influence from
the information gatherd from the previous task. It will not take a long time
to complete however will need to clear and target the project's aim.

Experiment Design
Design of the experiment will directly follow scenario design. This task will 
decide how data is collected by participant enaging with the VR system.

Documentation
Doucmentation (Physical Dissertation) will be constructed from the starting date
to the end of the project.

System Requirements/Design
The system design will be prepared by analying requriments from the scenario.
Hardware and software requirements will be specified.

System Development
From the system design the system will first be developed in small incremental stages.

System Testing
Fucntional and Non functional requirments will be tested in order to make sure the system is fully functional when conduting the experiment.

Experiment Execution


Hi there John

Attatchined is my proposal draft (Very Rough).

As you will find I am a little confussed between the main obectives and Gant chart objectives. Should they be identical? 

Thank you for your time

Kind Regards

O'Shea
