Virtual reality is a new-wave medium, which at present provides visual experiences via optical immersion. For the future, it has a copious range of potential applications within i.e. the education, gaming and medical industries. Through analysis of participant estimation both within a real and virtual environment, it is to be discoverd the extent to which a users perception of motion can be deceived within virtual reality.

Evidently monetary barriers to virtual reality depreciate as cost of its hardware decreases, this suggests an increase in potential consumers. Yet, the emancipatory confounds of VR restrict exploration and varied motion, which in turn breaks the illusion of walking around a real domain. This problem has been addressed with add-on hardware such as the Virtuix Omni. However two key obstacles face a 3rd party hardware solution (such as the Omni). Metaphorically its integration with developed software and literally its potential size. This indicates the need for a different solution. Researching a users perception of motion may address the issue of navigation within a virtual space.

As a result, this project will focus on a developing system, which manipulates the perception of an unknowing participant within a given virtual environment. As said prior, data will be collected on how much the participant’s perception is deceived. However first, one has to understand how perception can influence a human’s motion, this will prove the a crucial step when designing a deceptive scenario for a participant. 

After reaping the results from the experiment, it is expected that participants perception of motion will be deceived without any knowledge of sensory manipulation. If this is the case
