Cognitive resource demands of redirected walking’

Gerd states limited range of tracking, which is a key problem within VR.
He suggests there are alternatives to hardware components. (In this sence we are talking about tricking the sensory peroception of a user)
He states the human brain tends to unknowingly compensate for small incostinancies during walking, so this would enable the user to user a virtual space which is larger
than the real world domain.
However he suggests that a paths less than 22 meters long may lead to the user observing a discrepency. (As a result the virtual environment will be large.
He notes that the process of re direction forces the user to compensate in some way, this meansb the requirement of
additional cognitive resources may be needed from the user.

So he is suggesting the use of tasks whist rotating in order to measure the effect rotation has on cognitive resources.

The research suggests that an increase in manipulation has a direct correlation with dereased task performacne.
