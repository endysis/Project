Cognitive resource demands of redirected walking’

Gerd states limited range of tracking, which is a key problem within VR.
He suggests there are alternatives to hardware components. (In this sence we are talking about tricking the sensory peroception of a user)
He states the human brain tends to unknowingly compensate for small incostinancies during walking, so this would enable the user to user a virtual space which is larger
than the real world domain.
However he suggests that a paths less than 22 meters long may lead to the user observing a discrepency. (As a result the virtual environment will be large.
He notes that the process of re direction forces the user to compensate in some way, this meansb the requirement of
additional cognitive resources may be needed from the user.

So he is suggesting the use of tasks whist rotating in order to measure the effect rotation has on cognitive resources.




Author
- Gerd


Aim of paper
- To asses the correltion between virtual manipulation of a virtual environment and task performace conducted by a
  user.

Type of study/information
- Questionaire based on 3 cognitive conditions.

Key findings
- The research suggests that an increase in manipulation has a direct correlation with dereased task performacne.

Strengths weaknesses, links to other soucres
+ Actual suggests the best balance of virtual manipulation to in game interation performance
	- This i helpful understanding the types of tasks to give the user in my experiment.

_ However there is no indicator in this experiment that doing the tasks or any form of distaction aids in fooling
  in fooling a users perception.
